Problem Analysis: 
    The main goal of the program is focused around semaphores, moreover creating semaphores, storing them within an array, 
    and displaying the value of each semaphore. Also, the user will have the option to remove semaphores or leave them be. 
    In order to achieve these goals, we must implement the struc sem_ds to have access to semaphore data structures, a 
    unique identifier for a semaphore (“key”), and the union semun argument which is needed for semaphore control. The 
    built in functions that are utilized for this program are ftok() which is used to generate a unique key for a semaphore 
    in the self-referential directory(“.”). This function generates a value needed for semget(), which returns the value of 
    a Semapore identifier (Negative if there is an error). Additionally, semctl() is used in multiple ways, one where the 
    the cmd argument IPC_STAT to return the identifier of a structure for a given semaphore, and IPC_SETALL to initialize 
    all Semaphores to a corresponding values in a given array.
